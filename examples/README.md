# Examples

If you've installed `probe-rs` with `cargo install probe-rs --features cli`
just use `cargo run --example <filename>` to build and run any of the
examples.

For `channels-3d-1u` you can use also use
`cargo embed --example channels-3d-1u` which provides a nicer interface,
a terminal with 3 tabs and you can switch between the tabe using
F1, F2 and F3.

In all cases Ctrl-C terminates the program.

**TODO:** Document serial_*, inparticular how to setup the hardware!
